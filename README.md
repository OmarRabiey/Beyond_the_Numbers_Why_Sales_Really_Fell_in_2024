# Breaking the Spike The Real Story Behind Central Sales Decline 
A data-driven root cause analysis using Python to understand the 2017 sales decline in the Central region, uncover product, category, and customer-level issues, and evaluate whether 2016 was an outlier year.

 ## Root Cause Analysis of Central Region Sales Decline (2017 vs 2016) 📉
 ### Executive Summary 🧭

This project investigates the root causes behind the slight decrease in Central region sales in 2017 compared to 2016.
Using Python-based analysis, the project examines trends across states, cities, categories, products, and customers to understand what contributed to the change.
The analysis also evaluates whether the decline represents a real performance issue or if 2016 was an outlier year.

### 💼 Business Problem

Although the Central region reported a -0.22% decrease in sales in 2017, decision-makers need to understand:
What factors drove the decline
Which states, cities, categories, and products were impacted
Whether the drop reflects a real business issue or simply statistical noise
Which customer segments contributed most to the decline
Identifying the root causes ensures better planning, targeted marketing, and more accurate forecasting.

### 🔍 Deep Analysis Conclusion: Was the Decline Real or Just an Outlier Effect?


##### A critical question:
#### Is the 2017 decline an actual drop in performance, or was 2016 an outlier year?

#### 📈 Multi-Year Sales Comparison (Central Region)
###### Year	Sales
- 2014:	103,838

- 2015:	102,874

- 2016:	147,429

- 2017:	147,098

#### 🧠 Insight
- 2016 shows an abnormally high spike (+43% increase from previous years).

- 2017 sales are almost identical to 2016 (only -0.22% difference).

- 2017 remains far above historical norms (2014 & 2015).

#### ✔️ Final Interpretation
##### The decline in 2017 is not a real decline.
###### Instead:
- 2016 is an outlier year, and 2017 simply returned to a stable, high-performance baseline.
- 
- This means the business should not treat 2017 as a negative performance year — the true anomaly is the unusually high sales seen in 2016.
