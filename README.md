### 💼 Business Problem

Although the Central region reported a -0.22% decrease in sales in 2024, decision-makers need to understand:
What factors drove the decline
Which states, cities, categories, and products were impacted
Whether the drop reflects a real business issue or simply statistical noise
Which customer segments contributed most to the decline
Identifying the root causes ensures better planning, targeted marketing, and more accurate forecasting.

### 🔍 Deep Analysis Conclusion: Was the Decline Real or Just an Outlier Effect?


##### A critical question:
#### Is the 2024 decline an actual drop in performance, or was 2023 an outlier year?

#### 📈 Multi-Year Sales Comparison (Central Region)
###### Year	Sales
- 2021:	103,838
- 2022:	102,874
- 2023:	147,429
- 2024:	147,098

#### 🧠 Insight
- 2023 shows an abnormally high spike (+43% increase from previous years).
- 2024 sales are almost identical to 2023 (only -0.22% difference).
- 2024 remains far above historical norms (2021 & 2022).

#### ✔️ Final Interpretation
##### The decline in 2024 is not a real decline.
###### Instead:
- 2023 is an outlier year, and 2024 simply returned to a stable, high-performance baseline.
- This means the business should not treat 2024 as a negative performance year — the true anomaly is the unusually high sales seen in 2023.
